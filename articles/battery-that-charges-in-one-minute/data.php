$article = '<p>Henrik Fisker, a former chief designer for Aston Martin, claims that he will soon revolutionize the world of electric cars with a new, superior battery. Fisker started his own company and has filed patents on a new type of solid-state battery, which can be charged faster and has greater capacity than leading lithium-ion batteries, at least in theory.</p>
<p>In lithium-ion batteries, current flows through either liquids or polymers, but in solid-state batteries it flows through a solid. Although the technology is still in its infancy, these new batteries are designed to be cheaper and smaller than their lithium-ion counterpart.</p> 
<p>For now, the details of this design remain undisclosed. However, it will be able to hold 2.5-times the energy of a traditional lithium-ion battery, and it will charge at a much faster rate. Fisker even suggests that this battery could be charged in as little as one minute.</p>
<p>According to Fisker, “the unique thing about our battery is that the solvent that we use to build the battery is the cheapest one you can get – water.”</p>
<p>So far, the company has only showcased the battery at the Consumer Electronics Show. But, should it amount to a commercially-viable product, the lithium-ion batteries that currently power electric vehicles (EVs) could give way to these batteries and significantly advance EV capabilities and range.</p>
